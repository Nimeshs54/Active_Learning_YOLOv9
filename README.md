# Active_Learning_YOLOv9

This work introduces an innovative pipeline that effectively integrates Synthetic Data Generation with Active Learning (AL) algorithms to enhance the efficiency of real-world data acquisition and labeling. The proposed pipeline is structured into two distinct phases. The first phase, Synthetic Data Generation, involves creating high-fidelity synthetic data samples that closely mimic real-world scenarios, thereby augmenting the training dataset without extensive manual intervention. This phase establishes a strong foundational dataset that improves initial model performance and generalization. The second phase, Active Learning, utilizes AL techniques to selectively identify and label the most informative real-world data points, optimizing labeling efforts and reducing human labor. By focusing on these strategically chosen samples, the pipeline maximizes data acquisition efficiency and minimizes associated costs.
